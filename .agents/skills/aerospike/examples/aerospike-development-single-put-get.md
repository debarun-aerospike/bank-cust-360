# Official doc examples: create (put) and read (get)

**All languages.** The linked documentation page carries this in tabbed examples, in the canonical tab order: **Java SDK, Python SDK, Rust, C#, Go, Node.js, C, Java (legacy), Python (legacy)**. Java, Python and C are on essentially every page, with Go, C# and Node.js close behind; **Java SDK, Python SDK and Rust are still rolling out** and are present on a minority of pages today. The snippets below are one or two languages for orientation — the documentation is the complete set, and the client's own repository is authoritative for its API surface ([client-source-of-truth.md](../references/aerospike-development-client-source-of-truth.md)).

Aerospike publishes **full runnable Create/Read samples** on each language page (ufodata-style tutorials with GeoJSON, policies, etc.). **Do not duplicate** those long listings here—use the links below. The **minimal Python and Java** snippets only show connect → put → get shape.

**Official guides (Create + Read — use each page’s Code block for the full program):**

## Minimal examples

Full runnable samples live on each linked page.

### Python

```python
import aerospike

config = {"hosts": [("127.0.0.1", 3000)]}
client = aerospike.client(config).connect()

key = ("test", "demo", "user-1")
client.put(key, {"name": "Ada", "score": 42})
_, _, bins = client.get(key)
print(bins)

client.close()
```

### Java

```java
import com.aerospike.client.AerospikeClient;
import com.aerospike.client.Bin;
import com.aerospike.client.Key;
import com.aerospike.client.Record;

AerospikeClient client = new AerospikeClient("127.0.0.1", 3000);
try {
    Key key = new Key("test", "demo", "user-1");
    client.put(null, key, new Bin("name", "Ada"), new Bin("score", 42));
    Record record = client.get(null, key);
    System.out.println(record.bins);
} finally {
    client.close();
}
```
