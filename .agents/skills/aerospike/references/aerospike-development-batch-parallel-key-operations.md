## Use batch APIs for many primary-key operations

**Rule**

When reading or writing many records **by known primary keys**, use the client’s batch APIs instead of serial single-key calls, subject to reasonable batch sizes and error-handling needs.

**Batch policies** (parallelism, timeouts, and write-specific options) are separate from single-record policies—set **defaults per batch flavor** on the client when your SDK splits them (see [policy-client-defaults.md](aerospike-development-policy-client-defaults.md)). For **batch writes**, configure **`commitLevel`** (or equivalent) and, for **batch deletes**, **durable delete** flags to match namespace and correctness needs ([policy-write-commit-level.md](aerospike-development-policy-write-commit-level.md), [single-delete-durable-deletes.md](aerospike-development-single-delete-durable-deletes.md)).

**Why**

**Do not list the same key more than once in a single batch request.** Build the batch so each primary key appears at most once: **coalesce** multiple intended changes on the client before sending. If you need **several bin-level updates (or mixed read/write)** for **one** key in one round trip, use **`operate`** in the batch (or the SDK’s batch variant that carries multiple operations per key)—not multiple duplicate entries for that key.

**Per-key results:** A batch call can **complete without throwing** (or report an overall “success”) while **some keys or sub-operations fail**—for example not found, generation mismatch, **`KEY_BUSY`**, or policy errors on individual entries. After the batch returns, **inspect the status or result for each batch entry** (names vary by SDK: per-key records, arrays of results, iterators). Do **not** infer that every operation succeeded from the **top-level** outcome alone.

Batch APIs reduce round trips and let the cluster process key groups in parallel compared to naive loops. Repeating the same key in one batch is ambiguous or order-dependent across clients and wastes work; coalescing preserves clear semantics. Duplicate keys can also drive **extra latency** and **contention on that key** (the same record): the server may serialize or retry work on it repeatedly, worsening **hot-key** behavior and surfacing errors such as **`KEY_BUSY`** (or the client equivalent) under load. Multi-bin or mixed semantics for a single key belong in one **`operate`** chain per key (see [operate-record-lock-read-write.md](aerospike-development-operate-record-lock-read-write.md)).

**Prefer**

- Chunked batches if the SDK or service limits batch size
- **One entry per key** per batch; merge or drop duplicates on the client before `batch_*`
- **Batch `operate`** (or equivalent) when one key needs multiple operations atomically in the batch
- **After each batch:** walk **every** entry’s result code or exception slot—partial success is normal for batch APIs
- Retrying or compensating only for keys that **actually** failed (once you have per-key status)

**Avoid**

- Thousands of sequential gets when a batch interface exists
- **Duplicate keys** in the same batch when you can coalesce or combine into **`operate`**—especially on keys that are already hot or latency-sensitive
- Assuming **no exception** or **overall OK** means **every** key in the batch succeeded
