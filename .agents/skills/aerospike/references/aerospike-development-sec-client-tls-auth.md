## Terminate TLS and apply access credentials in the client

**Rule**

When the cluster requires TLS or access control, configure the client with the correct TLS context and credentials per official security guides—not custom shortcuts. Treat credentials as secrets; never embed them in repos.

**Why**

Misconfigured TLS or auth causes intermittent failures that look like “cluster flaps.” Security posture is a joint dev/ops concern; this rule covers **client-side** configuration only.

**Prefer**

- Follow the security docs for your client version
- Separate configs per environment

**Avoid**

- Disabling verification or using shared prod keys in dev without understanding risk
