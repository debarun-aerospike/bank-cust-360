## Use client error-rate backoff to protect the cluster under failure storms

**Rule**

Many Aerospike clients support **client-side error-rate limiting** (sometimes described as **backoff**): if a node returns **too many errors** within a **sliding window** of client tend iterations, the client **stops sending new commands** to that node until the error rate drops—surfacing a **backoff**-style exception to the application instead of hammering a sick node.

**Why**

Typical knobs (names vary by SDK): a **maximum error count** per window and an **error-rate window** length (often measured in **tend intervals**). When the limit is **disabled** (zero / off), no backoff is applied.

Under partial outages or misconfiguration, an unbounded client can amplify load on failing nodes and worsen cluster recovery. Backoff bounds blast radius and gives operators time to heal the cluster.

**Prefer**

- Enabling error-rate backoff for **large** or **autoscaled** app tiers sharing one cluster
- Pairing backoff awareness with **metrics and alerts** on the thrown exception class

**Avoid**

- Assuming every SDK exposes identical field names—**read your client’s policy docs**
- Treating backoff as a substitute for fixing **root cause** (network, capacity, config)
