## Size records for primary-index overhead and disk bandwidth

**Rule**

In **hybrid memory architecture (HMA)** and **All Flash** deployments, record data lives on device and **reads generally come from the storage path**—plan I/O accordingly. Aerospike does **not** keep an application-style DRAM cache of arbitrary records keyed by digest, so you cannot assume a hot record is free to re-read.

Each stored record costs about **64 bytes of RAM per replica** in the **primary index** (metadata to locate the object). **Hardware efficiency** depends on the **ratio** between **payload size** and that **fixed per-record overhead**: the band is **1–128 KiB** per record (the Goldilocks band), and it is a **distribution, not a target**. Design so the **bulk of records sit in single-digit KiB**; the upper end is headroom for **outliers** and **slowly-changing consolidated structures** (1:N and N:M relationship lists), not a size to aim for. **Above roughly 50 KiB, justify the record explicitly**—a sufficient justification names the per-record update rate and shows it is low ("rewritten when a subscription changes, a few times a month" clears the bar; "appended on every user action" does not).

- **Oversized records** drive **disk bandwidth** hard. Record data is stored **contiguously**, so every read fetches the **entire record** from storage and every write **rewrites the entire record**—Aerospike does not do in-place updates. Requesting a subset of bins trims what crosses the **network**, not what is read from **device**. A record in the tens of KiB spends tens of KiB of I/O on every access, however small the change (see [single-record-operations.md](aerospike-development-single-record-operations.md)).
- **Undersized records** (tiny values) mean you spend **a lot of memory on index entries** (many **64-byte** slots per gigabyte of “useful” data) and can push **RAM** limits before capacity.
- **Size only hurts once multiplied by write frequency.** The same 100 KiB record is unremarkable rewritten once an hour and a device-saturation problem rewritten thousands of times a second. Ask **how often a large record is rewritten**, not just how big it is. Where writes are infrequent relative to reads, records near the upper end are a **legitimate design, not a compromise**—low write throughput, or a cluster with I/O and network headroom, genuinely buys room. On a hot write path the same size is a defect: a 100 KiB record touched by a 15-byte append still spends 100 KiB of write I/O, replication traffic, and defrag load on **every** write.

**Why**

Two caches do exist, and both are bounded rather than general-purpose:

- **`post-write-cache`** (in-process, `storage-engine device`): retains the most recently written write-blocks in RAM, **default 256 MiB per device**. Reads of just-written records can be served from it without touching the device—valuable for XDR and read-after-write patterns. The [`cache_read_pct`](https://aerospike.com/docs/database/reference/metrics#namespace__cache_read_pct) metric shows how much of the read workload it absorbs. Note that blocks held here are **not eligible for defragmentation**, so keep it small relative to device size. (Named `post-write-queue` before Database 7.1.0.)
- **OS page cache**, via **`read-page-cache`** (default **`false`**): drops `O_DIRECT`/`O_DSYNC` on the read path so reads populate the kernel page cache and repeats can be served from RAM. Read path only—write guarantees are unaffected.

`read-page-cache` carries real constraints. It applies to `storage-engine device`, and the docs say explicitly **do not enable it when `data-in-memory` is `true`**. On older kernels or very fast storage, checking the page cache first can cost more than it saves, and a uniform read workload with no hot spots may gain nothing. In **Kubernetes**, page cache consumed by the container counts against the cgroup memory limit in both v1 and v2, so enabling it in a tightly-sized pod risks OOM kills. Test on a single node before rolling out. This is **operations-level** tuning and **does not replace** good **key design** (e.g. [model-hot-keys.md](aerospike-development-model-hot-keys.md)).

Modeling ignores index overhead and device I/O until clusters hit **latency**, **device saturation**, or **memory for the index**. The **64-byte**-per-record **per replica** rule of thumb makes **micro-records** surprisingly expensive in RAM, while **multi-megabyte** blobs stress devices even for “small” logical updates.

This band is a design target derived from index-to-data ratio, I/O size, and
defragmentation cost — not a measured hard boundary. If benchmarking on your
hardware and workload shows a different range, replace it here with the
verified figures and note the test conditions. The
`aerospike/data-modeling-guide` repository holds the fuller treatment, including
the distinction between this target band, the configured `max-record-size`
limit, and the architectural ceiling.

**Prefer**

- **Single-digit KiB for the bulk of records**, with 1–128 KiB as the band that distribution spans; treat anything over ~**50 KiB** as a decision to justify rather than a default
- Splitting or denormalizing **huge** documents across keys when hot paths only need part of the data
- Capacity planning that includes **index RAM** (records × replicas × ~64 B) **and** **device throughput** for object size × QPS
- **Storage compression** (LZ4 or zstd; zstd usually the better ratio-to-CPU trade) when records are large. Smaller on-disk records cut bytes read and written per operation directly, fit more records per write block (better defrag efficiency), and stretch both the post-write cache and page cache further
- Coordinating with **operations** on **`post-write-cache`** sizing and **`read-page-cache`** when **read-heavy** access to the **same blocks** dominates latency (after confirming **namespace** layout and the constraints above)

**Avoid**

- Carrying **sizing intuition from other databases**: B-tree and document stores apply an incremental update without rewriting the whole object, and in-memory stores have no device I/O to amortize. Neither holds in Aerospike—every update rewrites the full record contiguously
- Assuming a **tiny** bin payload is “free” on the server—it still pays **index + full storage I/O** on access
- Expecting **`read-page-cache`** to fix **application-level** hot keys by itself—**shard or spread** keys where needed first
- **Megabyte-scale** records on **hot** keys without measuring **disk** and **replication** cost
