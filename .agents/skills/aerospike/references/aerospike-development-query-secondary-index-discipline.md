## Design secondary indexes for query paths—not for every column

**Rule**

Use secondary indexes for predicates that match a **planned query path** at sensible cardinality. Do not index high-cardinality values (for example unique UUIDs per row) as a substitute for a primary key redesign. Prefer primary-key access when the key is known.

**Why**

Indexes have memory and write-amplification cost. Wrong index choices yield large candidate sets and slow queries. Aerospike’s fastest path remains direct primary-key access.

**Prefer**

- Modeling that answers “how do I look this up?” with PK when possible
- Indexes on fields that partition the key space usefully for queries

**Avoid**

- “Index everything” patterns carried over from relational databases
