## Keep lists and maps bounded

**Rule**

Never grow lists or maps without bounds. Records have a maximum size; unbounded appends cause failures and hot records. Use trims, capped policies, rank/size-limited reads, or partition data across keys.

**Why**

CDTs make it easy to append; operations teams see incidents when “history” or “feed” bins grow without limits. Large records also increase migration and I/O cost.

**Prefer**

- Server-side ops that trim or cap (where your model allows)
- Separate keys or sets when history must be long-lived at scale

**Avoid**

- Unbounded `append` to lists in hot paths
