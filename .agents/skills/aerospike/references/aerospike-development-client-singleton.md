## Use one Aerospike client per process

**Rule**

Instantiate the Aerospike client once per application process (or equivalent isolation boundary) and share it across threads/workers. Do not create and destroy a client per request.

**Why**

The client maintains connection pools to cluster nodes, background tending for topology changes, and other shared state. Per-request lifecycle causes socket churn, port exhaustion, repeated discovery work, and unstable latency.

**Prefer**

- A single global/module-level client initialized at startup
- Graceful `close` only on shutdown
- Explicit client logging in non-trivial deployments

**Avoid**

- `new client` / `connect` / `close` inside per-request handlers
